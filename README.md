## Overview

**Query Anomaly Detector** is a data-driven project implemented in Jupyter Notebooks for the detection of anomalies in query patterns using advanced machine learning and statistical techniques. The project is designed for data scientists, ML engineers, and researchers aiming to identify unusual or suspicious queries in large datasets.

## Concept & Methodology

### Problem Statement

Anomaly detection in queries aims to identify query records that deviate significantly from the norm, which may indicate data issues, fraud, or system misuse.

### Approach

1. **Data Acquisition**: Load and inspect query data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean, transform, and engineer features relevant to anomaly detection.
3. **Modeling**: Apply unsupervised ML models for anomaly detection.
4. **Evaluation**: Use metrics and visualization to interpret model performance.
5. **Inference**: Apply the trained model to new data to flag anomalies.

#### Algorithms Used

- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- TF - IDF vectorisation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Recommended: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

### Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Open the main notebook (e.g., `Query_Anomaly_Detector.ipynb`) and follow the instructions in the cells.**
3. **Replace or update input data as needed.**
4. **Run all cells to preprocess data, train the model, and view results.**

## Results

- **Performance Metrics:** [Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.]
- **Visualization:** Anomaly score distribution, confusion matrix, example flagged queries.
